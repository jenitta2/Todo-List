**Todo List** 

As the adage goes, **Time and tide waits for none**, a human must try the level best to effectively manage the **86,400 seconds**.

>Project Idea:

I have noticed that whenever I write down my day to day tasks, I complete them most probably. So, I searched for ways to do it as a web page for myself. So, I tried to build a notes web application with login facility. This to do list is a part of it.

>Project Description:

**What this application does?:**
It can add tasks for individual users by user authentication process. It can be used as a reminder of daily to do tasks.
